simple java routines 
/*
public means that the method is visible and can be called from other 
* objects of other types. Other alternatives are private, protected, 
* package and package-private. See here for more details.
* 
static means that the method is associated with the class, 
* not a specific instance (object) of that class. 
* This means that you can call a static method without 
* creating an object of the class.
void means that the method has no return value. 
* If the method returned an int 
* you would write int instead of void.
The combination of all three of these is most 
* commonly seen on the main method which most 
* tutorials will include.
